# Polymorphic Builder

  To use this builder you will need
  * `**Visual studio 2017** `

  * `**Python3** `


  First create a user for the panel using, for simplicity I created a route to do it

   "www.Your-Panel-Ip.com/createUser/{username}/{password}"



  This route can be disabled manually

  * `Admin / routes / web.php`

  And comment the line


  ```php
  Route :: get ('/ createUser / {username} / {password}', 'Auth_Controller @ createUser')

```
