# Polymorphic Builder

  To use this builder you will need
  * `**Visual studio 2017** `

  * `**Python3** `


  **First** - Create a panel user, for simplicity I created a route to do it

   "www.Your-Panel-Ip.com/createUser/{username}/{password}"

  This route can be disabled manually

  * `Admin / routes / web.php`

  Comment the line


  ```php
  Route :: get ('/ createUser / {username} / {password}', 'Auth_Controller @ createUser')
  ```
 **Second** - Save the PanelKey and CrypthKey then you need to base64 encode your panel Ip/domain like that
 Â 
   * ` http://You-Panel-ip/Api `

   You can use "https://www.base64encode.org/" for it.

   Than save your **Base64 encoded URl** to.

   I added a feature that allows you to use a backup Url that uses the website www.pastebin.com. This feature premies that in    case of any problem with the primary url, the owner of the botnet panel can use the paste to update the url panel.

   To use this you need to create an new paste on pastebin.com, base64 encode the raw version of the paste link like the main   panel url and save it with the other information.


  **Third** - Go to polymorphic builder folder with terminal and use the command :

  ```python
     python3 main.py
  ```

   Than add the the previous saved information to the respective fields.

   **Four** - Now we just need to compile. To do it you need open the folder named "Server" and click on .sln file to open with Visual Studio 2017 then Compile.
